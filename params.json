{"name":"Gitscm-next","tagline":"current version of the git-scm.com site","body":"# Git Homepage [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/github/gitscm-next.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/github/gitscm-next)\r\n\r\nThis is the web application for the [git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com) site.  It is meant to be the\r\nfirst place that a person new to Git will land and download or learn about the\r\nGit SCM system.\r\n\r\nThis app is written in Ruby on Rails and deployed on Heroku.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nYou'll need a Ruby environment to run Rails.  First do:\r\n\r\n    $ rvm use 1.9.2\r\n    $ bundle install\r\n\r\nThen you need to create the database structure:\r\n\r\n    $ rake db:migrate\r\n\r\nNow you'll want to populate the man pages.  You can do so from a local Git\r\nsource clone like this:\r\n\r\n    $ GIT_REPO=../git/.git rake local_index\r\n\r\nOr you can do it from GitHub (much slower) like this:\r\n\r\n    $ rake preindex\r\n\r\nNow you need to get the latest downloads for the downloads pages:\r\n\r\n    $ rake downloads\r\n\r\nNow you'll probably want some book data. You'll have\r\nto have access to the progit project on the Github through the API.\r\n\r\n    $ export API_USER=github_username\r\n    $ export API_PASS=github_password\r\n    $ rake remote_genbook\r\n\r\nThat will generate the book content from the markdown files fetched from the online repository  and post it to the Rails server database.\r\n\r\nNow you can run the Rails site to take a look.  Specify an UPDATE_TOKEN so you\r\ncan use the world's stupidest authentication mechanism:\r\n\r\n    $ UPDATE_TOKEN=something rails server\r\n\r\nThe site should be running on http://localhost:3000\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTo run the tests for this project, run:\r\n\r\n    $ rake test\r\n\r\nTo run the website for testing purposes, run:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle exec rackup config.ru\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you wish to contribute to this website, please [fork it on GitHub](https://github.com/github/gitscm-next), push your\r\nchange to a named branch, then send me a pull request. If it is a big feature,\r\nyou might want to contact me first to make sure it's something that I'll\r\naccept.  If it involves code, please also write tests for it.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis source code for the site is licensed under the MIT, which you can find in\r\nthe MIT-LICENSE.txt file.\r\n\r\nAll graphical assets are licensed under the\r\n[Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
